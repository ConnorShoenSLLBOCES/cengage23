			<span class="bio"><p>The eighth item on my list is Hellboy: Web of Wyrd for the Nintendo Switch. <br>
				-Developed by Upstream Arcade, Hellboy Web of Wyrd utilizes an art style faithful to Mike Mignola’s original masterpieces. Like in the comics, the game sends Hellboy on a series of vastly different and wholly-unique adventures; and while each story stands on its own, they are all tied to the mysterious legacy of The Butterfly House.
					<br>
				-Welcome to the Wyrd: Built in 1962 by occultist Pasquale Deneveaux, The Butterfly House is more than a mere residence; it’s a gateway. Built upon occult ley-energies, its strange angles and non-Euclidean geometries were designed with a singular foul purpose in mind: to open doorways into a terrible and fascinating dimension called The Wyrd.
					<br>
				-Roguelike Action Brawler: Go toe-to-toe (or hoof-to-hoof) with a menagerie of nightmarish creatures and homunculi as you explore the realms within the Wyrd. Combat has been engineered to create challenging encounters that encourage you to learn patterns, dodge, parry, and - of course - punch your enemies into oblivion.
